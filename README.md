Welcome to HΞX

HΞX is an opportunity to wager on hashed hexadecimal digits.

You select the hex numbers that will appear in the last eight digits of a cryptographic hash, generated by a smart contract.

If one of your chosen numbers appears, you get back your stake plus the same again for each appearance.

For example, if you wager 0.1ETH on the number 8, and the last eight digits of the hash are 8182D833, you will get back 0.4ETH; 0.1ETH for the original stake and 0.3ETH for the three times that the number 8 appears.

You can wager on as many of the numbers as you wish, up to a maximum of 0.5ETH on each number.

The maximum amount that you can wager on any digit is set at a level (currently 0.5ETH) that will ensure that the size of the pot will always cover the maximum possible pay out.

The smart contract uses a relatively simple, and transparent way to generate the hash. This can be seen in the Smart Contract at

While this method could be subject to manipulation by Miners, the opportunity cost in doing so would be such as to make attempted manipulation uneconomic. To ensure that this continues to be the case, the maximum wager will always be limited to 1.0ETH.
